## üõ† Technical Architecture

### Backend (Railway)
- **Service**: `backend/src/services/soraVideoService.ts`
  - Handles OpenAI Sora 2 API calls
  - Manages video generation polling
  - Uploads completed videos to Supabase Storage
  - Tracks generation status

- **API Routes**: `backend/src/api/routes/sora.ts`
  - `POST /api/sora/generate` - Initiate video generation
  - `GET /api/sora/videos` - Get user's video history
  - `GET /api/sora/videos/:videoId` - Get specific video
  - `DELETE /api/sora/videos/:videoId` - Delete video
  - `POST /api/sora/prompts/*` - Generate optimized prompts

### Database (Supabase)
- **Table**: `user_generated_videos`
  - Stores video metadata and generation status
  - Row Level Security (RLS) enabled
  - Tracks views, downloads, shares

### Frontend (React Native)
- **Component**: `app/components/SoraVideoGenerator.tsx`
  - Main UI for video generation
  - Video library and player
  - Tier-gated access controls

- **Loading Component**: `app/components/VideoGenerationLoader.tsx`
  - Beautiful animated loading UI
  - Progress tracking
  - User-friendly status messages

- **Service**: `app/services/api/soraVideoService.ts`
  - API calls to backend
  - Real-time status subscriptions
  - Video management utilities

## üìù Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Variables

Add to your Railway backend environment:

```bash
# OpenAI API Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-your-openai-api-key-here
```

**Important**: You need a OpenAI account with Sora 2 API access. As of October 2025, Sora 2 is in limited preview. Apply for access at: https://openai.com/sora

### 2. Supabase Storage Setup

Create a storage bucket for videos:

```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
-- Create storage bucket for generated videos
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public, file_size_limit, allowed_mime_types)
VALUES (
  'generated-videos',
  'generated-videos',
  true,
  524288000, -- 500MB limit per file
  ARRAY['video/mp4', 'video/quicktime']
);

-- Set up storage policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload their own videos"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'generated-videos' 
  AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);

CREATE POLICY "Videos are publicly accessible"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
USING (bucket_id = 'generated-videos');

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own videos"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
USING (
  bucket_id = 'generated-videos' 
  AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]
);
```

### 3. Database Function (Helper)

```sql
-- Create helper function to increment view count
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION increment_video_views(video_id UUID)
RETURNS void AS $$
BEGIN
  UPDATE user_generated_videos
  SET views_count = views_count + 1
  WHERE id = video_id;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
```

### 4. Package Installation

The required packages are already in your `package.json`:
- `openai@^4.28.0` (backend)
- `expo-av` (frontend - for video playback)

If you need to reinstall:

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
npm install openai

# Frontend (if needed)
cd ..
npm install expo-av
```

## üéØ Usage Flow

### User Journey

1. **Discovery**: User sees the beautiful gradient card on the home screen
   ```
   üé¨ AI Video Generator
   Create epic sports videos with Sora 2
   ```

2. **Selection**: User taps to open modal with video type options:
   - AI Pick Hype (FREE)
   - Game Countdown (PRO - locked for free users)
   - Player Spotlight (PRO - locked)
   - Weekly Recap (ELITE - locked)

3. **Generation**: 
   - User selects "AI Pick Hype"
   - Beautiful loading animation appears with rotating film icon
   - Progress bar shows generation status (typically 30-60 seconds)
   - Real-time updates via Supabase subscriptions

4. **Completion**:
   - Alert notification when video is ready
   - Video auto-plays in modal
   - Options to download, share, or delete
   - Video saved to user's library

5. **Library**:
   - Horizontal scroll of recent videos on home screen
   - Full library view in modal
   - Each video shows title, date, view count

## üí∞ Pricing Considerations

### OpenAI Sora 2 Costs
- **Sora 2**: ~$0.10 per second (720x1280 or 1280x720)
- **Sora 2 Pro**: ~$0.30 per second (higher quality, 1024x1792)

### Cost Examples
- 10-second AI Pick Hype: $1.00
- 15-second Game Countdown: $1.50
- 30-second Weekly Recap: $3.00

### Revenue Model
- FREE tier: 1 video/week = ~$4/month cost
- PRO tier: 3 videos/day = ~$90/month cost
- ELITE tier: Unlimited (cap at 10/day) = ~$300/month cost

**Recommendation**: Set hard limits per tier and monitor costs closely. Consider implementing video caching/reuse for similar picks.

## üîí Security & Tier Enforcement

### Backend Tier Checks
The backend validates subscription tier before allowing generation:

```typescript
// Checks in backend/src/api/routes/sora.ts
- FREE: Only 'ai_pick_hype' allowed, 1 per week
- PRO: 'ai_pick_hype', 'game_countdown', 'player_spotlight', 3 per day
- ELITE: All types, 10 per day
```

### Frontend Tier Gating
UI shows locked states with upgrade prompts for premium features.

## üìä Monitoring & Analytics

Track these metrics:
- Total videos generated per day/week
- Cost per user tier
- Video view rates
- Conversion rate from free to paid (attributed to video feature)
- Popular video types

Add to your backend logging:
```typescript
logger.info(`Video generated: ${videoType} for user ${userId}, tier: ${tier}`);
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"OPENAI_API_KEY is not configured"**
   - Ensure environment variable is set in Railway
   - Restart the backend service

2. **"Failed to upload video"**
   - Check Supabase storage bucket exists
   - Verify storage policies are correct
   - Check file size limits

3. **Video generation stuck at "processing"**
   - OpenAI API may be slow (normal: 30-60s)
   - Check backend logs for errors
   - Verify polling is working

4. **"Daily limit reached"**
   - User has hit their tier's daily limit
   - Check generation count in database

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
1. **Video Templates**: Pre-designed templates for different sports
2. **Custom Branding**: User's logo on videos
3. **Social Sharing**: Direct share to Twitter/Instagram
4. **Video Editing**: Trim, add text overlays
5. **Background Music**: Custom soundtrack options
6. **Parlay Videos**: Generate videos for multi-leg parlays
7. **Live Game Highlights**: Auto-generate from live game data
8. **Thumbnail Extraction**: Better thumbnails using ffmpeg

### Performance Optimizations
1. Cache similar prompts to reduce API calls
2. Implement queue system for bulk generations
3. Add video compression before storage
4. Implement CDN for faster video delivery

## üìû Support

For issues with Sora 2 integration:
1. Check backend logs in Railway
2. Verify Supabase storage and database
3. Test OpenAI API key separately
4. Monitor generation queue status

## üéâ Success Metrics

After launch, track:
- **User Engagement**: Videos generated per active user
- **Retention**: Users who generate videos vs. those who don't
- **Conversion**: Free ‚Üí Pro upgrades attributed to video feature
- **Virality**: Videos shared on social media
- **Cost Efficiency**: Revenue per video generated
