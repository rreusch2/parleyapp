# 🎬 Sora 2 Video Generator - Quick Start

## What Was Built

I've integrated OpenAI's Sora 2 AI video generation into your sports betting app! Users can now create epic, cinematic videos from their AI picks. This is a **complete, production-ready implementation**.

## 🎯 Features You Get

### 4 Video Types (Tier-Gated for Monetization):

1. **🔥 AI Pick Hype** (FREE)
   - Dramatic 8-second videos of user's best AI pick
   - FREE: 1/week | PRO: 3/day | ELITE: Unlimited

2. **⏰ Game Countdown** (PRO)
   - 15-second cinematic countdowns to game time
   - Stadium shots, fan energy, epic reveals

3. **⭐ Player Spotlight** (PRO)
   - Highlight reels of predicted player performance

4. **🏆 Weekly Recap** (ELITE)
   - 25-second celebration videos of weekly wins
   - Stats, confetti, trophy shots

## 🚀 Setup (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Add OpenAI API Key to Railway

```bash
# In your Railway backend service, add this environment variable:
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-your-openai-api-key-here
```

**Get API Key**: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

**Important**: Sora 2 is in limited preview. You may need to apply for access:
https://openai.com/sora

### Step 2: Create Supabase Storage Bucket

**IMPORTANT**: You CANNOT create buckets via SQL - must use Dashboard!

#### 2a. Create Bucket (Dashboard UI):
1. Go to **Supabase** → **Storage**
2. Click **"New bucket"**
3. Name: `generated-videos`
4. Public: ✅ YES
5. File size limit: `500 MB`
6. MIME types: `video/mp4`, `video/quicktime`, `video/webm`

#### 2b. Run SQL for Policies:
See detailed instructions in `SUPABASE_STORAGE_SETUP.md`

Or quick version: Copy the SQL from `backend/sql/setup_sora_storage.sql` (lines 30+) and run in SQL Editor

### Step 3: Restart Your Backend

```bash
# Your Railway backend will auto-restart after adding the env var
# Or manually restart it
```

### Step 4: Test It Out!

1. Open your React Native app
2. Go to Home tab
3. Look for the new gradient card: **"AI Video Generator 🎬"**
4. Tap it and select "AI Pick Hype"
5. Watch the magic happen! ✨

## 📊 Monitoring

Track these metrics in your database:

```sql
-- Check video generation stats
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_videos,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN generation_status = 'completed' THEN 1 END) as completed,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN generation_status = 'failed' THEN 1 END) as failed,
  AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (generation_completed_at - generation_started_at))) as avg_duration_seconds
FROM user_generated_videos
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days';

-- Check costs per user tier
SELECT 
  p.subscription_tier,
  COUNT(v.id) as videos_generated,
  COUNT(v.id) * 10 * 0.10 as estimated_cost_usd
FROM user_generated_videos v
JOIN profiles p ON p.id = v.user_id
WHERE v.created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY p.subscription_tier;
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "OPENAI_API_KEY is not configured"
→ Add the environment variable to Railway and restart

### "Failed to upload video"
→ Run the SQL setup script for storage bucket

### Video stuck at "processing"
→ Normal! Can take 30-60 seconds. Check backend logs.

### "Daily limit reached"
→ User hit their tier limit. Upgrade prompt will show.

## 🎯 Marketing Ideas

### Email Campaigns
"🎬 NEW: Turn Your Winning Picks Into Hollywood-Style Videos"

### Social Media
Share user-generated videos with watermarks:
"Made with ParleyApp AI Video Generator"

### Conversion Strategy
1. Give free users 1 video/week (taste of premium)
2. Show locked video types with "Upgrade to unlock"
3. Highlight in onboarding: "Create your own sports highlights!"
