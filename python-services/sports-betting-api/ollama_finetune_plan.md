# Fine-tuning Local Ollama DeepSeek for Sports Betting

## What Fine-tuning Would Do:
- Train the LLM itself to be better at sports betting analysis
- Make it understand betting terminology, odds, team analysis
- Improve reasoning about value bets and risk assessment

## Current Setup:
- **Cloud DeepSeek**: Uses your trained models via API calls (current approach)
- **Local Ollama**: Could be fine-tuned to understand sports betting directly

## Fine-tuning Process:

### 1. Prepare Training Data
```bash
# Create training examples like:
{
  "input": "Arsenal vs Chelsea, Arsenal odds: 2.1, Chelsea odds: 3.2, Draw: 3.5. Arsenal has won 3 of last 5 home games.",
  "output": "Analysis: Arsenal has home advantage and better recent form. Implied probability from odds: Arsenal 47.6%, Chelsea 31.3%, Draw 28.6%. The market slightly undervalues Arsenal given their home record. Recommended bet: Arsenal ML with 1-2% of bankroll."
}
```

### 2. Local Training Commands
```bash
# With Ollama (if supported):
ollama create my-sports-deepseek -f ./Modelfile
ollama run my-sports-deepseek

# Or with other tools:
# Use LoRA fine-tuning on your local GPU
```

### 3. Benefits vs Current Approach:

**Current (Cloud DeepSeek + Traditional ML):**
✅ Already working
✅ Uses proven ML algorithms  
✅ Real data validation
❌ Costs API calls
❌ LLM not specialized for sports

**Fine-tuned Local Ollama:**
✅ Specialized for sports betting
✅ No API costs
✅ Privacy (all local)
❌ Requires training time/data
❌ GPU requirements
❌ Model management complexity

## Recommendation:
**Keep current system AND experiment with local fine-tuning in parallel**

### Quick Test: Compare Approaches
1. Current: Cloud DeepSeek + Traditional ML models
2. Local: Fine-tuned Ollama DeepSeek
3. Hybrid: Both systems making predictions, compare accuracy

## Next Steps:
1. **Immediate**: Train traditional models on more data (easy wins)
2. **Short-term**: Create sports betting training dataset
3. **Long-term**: Fine-tune local Ollama model
4. **Always**: Compare all approaches on real data
