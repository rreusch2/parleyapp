# AlphaPy Data Collection Strategy
## Getting Massive Structured Sports Data for Training

### Phase 1: FREE Historical Data (Start Here!)

#### 1. Kaggle Datasets (Immediate Download)
```bash
# Install kaggle CLI
pip install kaggle

# Download massive free datasets
kaggle datasets download -d maxhorowitz/nflplaybyplay2009to2016
kaggle datasets download -d seanlahman/the-history-of-baseball  
kaggle datasets download -d hugomathien/soccer
kaggle datasets download -d sportradar/baseball
```

**What you get:**
- 500k+ NFL plays with outcomes
- 100k+ MLB games with detailed stats
- 25k+ soccer matches with player attributes
- Ready for AlphaPy training immediately

#### 2. Sports-Reference Scraping (FREE)
```python
# Simple scraping script for historical data
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import pandas as pd

def scrape_baseball_reference(year):
    url = f"https://www.baseball-reference.com/years/{year}-schedule.shtml"
    # Scrape game results, scores, etc.
    # Returns structured DataFrame perfect for AlphaPy
```

**What you get:**
- Every game result since 1871 (MLB)
- Team statistics by season
- Player performance data
- Weather conditions, attendance, etc.

#### 3. ESPN API Enhancement (You Already Have This!)
```python
# Enhance your existing ESPN data collection
def collect_historical_espn_data():
    # Use your existing ESPN API setup
    # Collect 5+ years of historical games
    # Store in AlphaPy-compatible format
```

### Phase 2: Betting Odds Data (Small Cost, Huge Value)

#### The Odds API ($30/month for training period)
```python
# Historical odds for model training
import requests

def get_historical_odds():
    # Get 2+ years of historical betting lines
    # Moneyline, spread, totals for all games
    # Perfect for training AlphaPy value betting models
```

**Training Budget:**
- Month 1-2: $30/month for historical odds
- Month 3+: Use trained models, minimal API calls
- **Total training cost: ~$60**

### Phase 3: Data Preprocessing for AlphaPy

#### Convert to AlphaPy Format
```python
# Transform raw data to AlphaPy SportFlow format
def prepare_alphapy_data(raw_data):
    # Features: team stats, player stats, weather, etc.
    # Targets: game outcomes, point spreads, totals
    # Format: CSV files AlphaPy can directly ingest
    
    features = pd.DataFrame({
        'home_team_rating': [...],
        'away_team_rating': [...], 
        'home_recent_form': [...],
        'weather_temp': [...],
        'days_rest': [...],
        # 50+ engineered features
    })
    
    targets = pd.DataFrame({
        'home_win': [...],        # Binary outcome
        'point_spread': [...],    # Actual spread
        'total_points': [...],    # Game total
        'home_score': [...],      # Individual scores
        'away_score': [...]
    })
    
    return features, targets
```

### Phase 4: AlphaPy Training Pipeline

#### Automated Data Collection
```python
# Daily data collection script
def daily_data_update():
    # Collect yesterday's results
    # Update training dataset
    # Retrain AlphaPy models
    # Takes 10 minutes, runs automatically
```

#### Model Training
```python
# AlphaPy training configuration
ALPHAPY_CONFIG = {
    'data_dir': 'data/sports/',
    'model_dir': 'models/',
    'algorithms': ['XGBoost', 'LightGBM', 'RandomForest'],
    'ensemble': True,
    'cv_folds': 5,
    'target_columns': ['home_win', 'point_spread', 'total_points']
}
```
