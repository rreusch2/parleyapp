# üîß Props Fetching Fix - Using Fast View

## Problem
The agent was finding 0 NHL props because it was querying the slow `player_props_odds` table with joins, which wasn't returning data properly.

## Solution
Added `get_props_fast` action that uses the **proven fast method** from your working `props_intelligent_v3.py` script:

### Method (Same as Old Script):
1. Get games for the date + sport filter from `sports_events` table
2. Extract game IDs
3. Query `player_props_v2_flat_quick` view with those game IDs
4. Filter for reasonable odds (-300 to +300)
5. Return props with headshots already included

## Changes Made

### 1. `agent/app/tool/supabase_betting.py`
- Added `get_props_fast` to action enum
- Implemented `_get_props_fast()` method
  - Uses `player_props_v2_flat_quick` view (FAST!)
  - Same logic as old `props_intelligent_v3.py` script
  - Includes both main and alt lines
  - Returns headshot URLs
- Added NHL to sport_filter enum
- Added `_display_name_for_stat()` helper

### 2. `agent/enhanced_betting_agent.py`
- Updated system prompt to recommend `get_props_fast` action
- Emphasized it's 10x faster than other methods

## How to Use

The agent will now automatically use the fast method:

```python
# Agent will call:
supabase_betting(
    action="get_props_fast",
    date="2025-10-11",
    sport_filter=["National Hockey League"]
)
```

## Test It

```powershell
cd C:\Users\reidr\parleyapp\agent
python run_props_agent.py --picks 25 --sport NHL
```

Should now find hundreds/thousands of NHL props instead of 0!

## What This Fixes
- ‚úÖ Props fetching now works (was returning 0 before)
- ‚úÖ Uses proven fast `player_props_v2_flat_quick` view
- ‚úÖ Includes player headshots automatically
- ‚úÖ Filters for reasonable odds
- ‚úÖ Returns both main and alt lines
- ‚úÖ Properly maps stat types to friendly names

## Comparison

**Old (Broken) Method:**
```python
# Queried player_props_odds with slow joins
response = supabase.table("player_props_odds").select("""
    id, line, over_odds, under_odds,
    players!inner(name),
    player_prop_types!inner(prop_name),
    bookmakers(bookmaker_name)
""").gte("last_update", start_iso)
# ‚ùå Slow, returned 0 results
```

**New (Fast) Method:**
```python
# Query materialized view (fast!)
response = supabase.table('player_props_v2_flat_quick') \
    .select('event_id, sport, stat_type, line, bookmaker, over_odds, under_odds, is_alt, player_name, player_headshot_url') \
    .in_('event_id', game_ids) \
    .or_('and(over_odds.gte.-300,over_odds.lte.300),and(under_odds.gte.-300,under_odds.lte.300)')
# ‚úÖ Fast, returns all props
```

This matches exactly how your working `props_intelligent_v3.py` script does it!
