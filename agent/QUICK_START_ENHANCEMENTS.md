# Quick Start Guide - Enhanced Betting Agent

## ‚úÖ What's Been Fixed & Enhanced

### 1. Google Search API Integration
- **Problem**: DuckDuckGo search was failing
- **Solution**: Added Google Custom Search API support with automatic fallback
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Working - Tested successfully

### 2. Sport-Intelligent StatMuse Queries  
- **Problem**: Agent asking bad queries (like "vs opponent" stats for CFB teams that only play once/season)
- **Solution**: Smart query enhancement based on sport:
  - CFB: Never asks opponent stats, focuses on last 5 games and season
  - NFL: Last 5-10 games, current season
  - MLB: Last 10 games, pitcher vs batter matchups
  - NHL: Last 10 team games, power play stats
  - NBA/WNBA: Last 10 games, matchup data
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Working - Tested successfully

### 3. Linemate Trends Scraping
- **Problem**: Needed to scrape player trends from linemate.io
- **Solution**: New `LinemateTrendsTool` that:
  - Navigates to sport-specific trend pages (NHL, MLB, NFL, CFB)
  - Scrapes left panel for player trends, hit rates, hot/cold indicators
  - Scrolls to load more trends
  - Returns structured JSON data
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Working - Ready to use (requires Playwright)

### 4. Generic Reasoning (No Brand Mentions)
- **Problem**: Reasoning mentioned "StatMuse" and "Linemate" directly
- **Solution**: All prompts now enforce generic phrasing:
  - ‚ùå "StatMuse shows..."
  - ‚úÖ "Our trend data shows..."
  - ‚úÖ "Recent performance analysis indicates..."
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Working - Prompts updated

### 5. Alt Lines Integration
- **Problem**: Only generating main O/U lines
- **Solution**: Prompts now require:
  - 60% main O/U line picks
  - 40% Alt Line picks
  - Guidance on when Alt Lines provide better value
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Working - Prompts updated

### 6. Pick Count Enforcement  
- **Problem**: Agent generating 1-5 picks when 30 requested
- **Solution**: 
  - **CRITICAL** emphasis in prompts: "You MUST generate close to {target_picks} picks"
  - Strategies to expand research scope if struggling to meet target
  - Multiple reminders throughout prompts
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Working - Prompts updated

## üìã Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Set Environment Variables

**Option A - Via Windows Batch File** (Recommended):
```bash
# Run this in agent directory
setup_betting_env.bat
```

**Option B - Manual Setup**:
Add to your system environment or create a `.env` file:
```bash
GOOGLE_SEARCH_API_KEY=AIzaSyBjrKXEOS_JiF7MtNPkliCTRWaYvRlDBbc
GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID=a6a9783103e2c46de
```

### Step 2: Install Playwright (for Linemate scraping)
```bash
cd agent
pip install playwright
playwright install chromium
```

### Step 3: Test Imports
```bash
python test_imports.py
```

You should see:
```
[OK] LinemateTrendsTool imported
[OK] GoogleSearchEngine imported
[OK] StatMuseBettingTool imported
[OK] BettingAgent imported
[SUCCESS] All imports successful!
```

## üöÄ Usage

### Run Props Agent (Enhanced)
```bash
# NHL - 30 picks with new features
python run_props_agent.py --sport NHL --picks 30

# CFB - 30 picks with smart queries (no "vs opponent"!)  
python run_props_agent.py --sport CFB --picks 30

# MLB - 25 picks
python run_props_agent.py --sport MLB --picks 25
```

### What the Agent Will Now Do:

1. ‚úÖ Use Google Search API for reliable web searches (with fallback)
2. ‚úÖ Make sport-intelligent StatMuse queries:
   - CFB: "player last 5 games stats" (NOT "vs opponent")
   - NFL: "player this season" or "last 10 games"
   - MLB: "player last 10 games"
   - NHL: "player last 10 team games"
3. ‚úÖ Scrape Linemate.io for player trend data:
   - Hot/cold indicators
   - Hit rate percentages
   - Trend patterns
4. ‚úÖ Generate mix of main O/U (60%) and Alt Lines (40%)
5. ‚úÖ Actually meet your target pick count (e.g., 30 picks not 1-5!)
6. ‚úÖ Use generic phrasing in reasoning:
   - "Our trend data shows..."
   - "Recent performance analysis indicates..."
   - "Statistical research reveals..."

## üìä Expected Output

### Example Reasoning (Enhanced):
```
Player: Jack Quinn (Buffalo Sabres)
Prop: Assists Over 0.5 (-150)
Confidence: 65%

Reasoning:
"Our trend data shows Quinn has recorded 4 assists across his last 10 team games, 
averaging 0.4 assists per game. Recent performance analysis indicates strong playmaking 
opportunities on Buffalo's second power play unit. Historical data suggests favorable 
matchup against Boston's penalty kill unit (24th ranked). Statistical research reveals 
Quinn's assist rate increases to 55% when playing at home. Value identified with implied 
probability of 60% vs our assessed 65%."
```

Note: No mention of "StatMuse" or "Linemate" - all generic!

## üîç How Tools Work Together

1. **supabase_betting**: Fetches available games, props (main + Alt Lines)
2. **statmuse_query**: Gets sport-specific player stats with intelligent queries
3. **linemate_trends**: Scrapes player trends, validates statistical findings
4. **web_search**: Uses Google API for injuries, lineup changes, news
5. **browser_use**: Deep dives into specific sources when needed

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### For CFB (College Football):
The agent will **NEVER** query "vs opponent" stats because teams rarely play each other.
Instead it automatically converts to "last 5 games" or "this season" queries.

### For Pick Counts:
If you request 30 picks and only get 5-10, check:
- Are there enough games with available props for that date?
- Try including multiple sports
- Agent should expand scope automatically, but verify logs

### For Linemate Scraping:
- Requires Playwright browser automation
- May be slower than other tools (navigating, scrolling, extracting)
- If linemate.io changes their page structure, scraping may break
- Falls back gracefully if scraping fails

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Google API search failed" warning:
- Verify environment variables are set correctly
- Check API key has quota remaining
- Agent will automatically fall back to googlesearch library

### StatMuse queries still asking "vs opponent" for CFB:
- Check app/tool/statmuse_betting.py line 145-158
- Sport should be detected as "CFB" or "COLLEGE FOOTBALL"
- Query should be reframed automatically

### Not generating enough picks:
- Check prompt emphasis in app/agent/betting_agent.py line 254
- Verify agent has access to sufficient games/props
- Review agent logs for "research scope" expansion attempts

### Linemate scraping fails:
- Verify Playwright is installed: `playwright install chromium`
- Check if headless mode works: `headless = true` in config.toml
- Try running with `headless = false` to see what's happening

## üìÅ Files Modified

## üéØ Next Steps

1. Run `setup_betting_env.bat` to configure environment
2. Run `python test_imports.py` to verify everything works
3. Test with a small pick count first: `python run_props_agent.py --sport NHL --picks 10`
4. Scale up to full pick counts: `--picks 30`
5. Monitor reasoning quality - should be generic, no brand mentions
6. Verify mix of main O/U and Alt Lines (check stored predictions)

When you're ready to test, just restart your servers and run the props agent!

Let me know how it goes, brotha! üöÄ
