# Google Search API - FIXED âœ…

## Problem
- Agent was trying DuckDuckGo which kept timing out
- Google API keys were NOT being loaded from environment
- .env file didn't exist

## Solution Applied

### 1. Created .env File in agent/ Directory
```
GOOGLE_SEARCH_API_KEY=AIzaSyBjrKXEOS_JiF7MtNPkliCTRWaYvRlDBbc
GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID=a6a9783103e2c46de
```

### 2. Fixed run_props_agent.py
- Moved `load_dotenv()` to load .env BEFORE any imports
- This ensures GoogleSearchEngine sees the env vars when initialized

### 3. Updated config.toml
- Set `fallback_engines = []` to prevent DuckDuckGo fallback
- Google is now the ONLY search engine used

### 4. Added Debug Logging
- Google search now prints when it's using API vs scraping
- Shows how many results were returned
- Makes debugging easier

##Test Results
```
[OK] Google Custom Search API configured (key: ...YvRlDBbc)
[SEARCH] Using Google Custom Search API for: BYU football injury report...
[OK] Google API returned 3 results
```

## How to Run

Just run your props agent normally:
```bash
cd agent
python run_props_agent.py --sport CFB --picks 30
```

The Google API will now work automatically - NO MORE DUCKDUCKGO TIMEOUTS!

## Files Modified
- `agent/.env` - **NEW** (contains your Google API credentials)
- `agent/run_props_agent.py` - Loads .env before imports
- `agent/config/config.toml` - No fallback engines
- `agent/app/tool/search/google_search.py` - Better logging, no emojis (Windows compatibility)

## Next Steps
Test the full agent! It should now:
1. Use Google Search API successfully
2. Get real search results quickly  
3. Not waste time on DuckDuckGo timeouts
4. Generate picks faster

Have fun brotha! ðŸš€
