# Enhanced Betting Agent - Complete System Overview

## 🎯 What This Is

A **truly agentic** sports betting analysis system that replaces the mechanical `props_intelligent_v3.py` script with an intelligent agent that thinks, adapts, and investigates like a professional sharp bettor.

### The Problem We Solved

Your old script (`props_intelligent_v3.py`) was too mechanical:
- ❌ Rigid workflow: Get data → AI plans → Execute mechanically → AI generates picks → Store
- ❌ No adaptability: Couldn't pivot based on discoveries
- ❌ Ping-pong pattern: Script controls flow, AI just responds
- ❌ Limited intelligence: Treats AI as a tool, not an agent

### The Solution

An **autonomous agent** powered by advanced prompt engineering:
- ✅ **ReAct Pattern**: Continuous think→act→observe→adapt cycles
- ✅ **Chain-of-Thought**: Explicit reasoning before every action
- ✅ **Dynamic Planning**: Uses planning tool for complex multi-step research
- ✅ **Adaptive Behavior**: Pivots strategy based on findings
- ✅ **Tool Autonomy**: Decides which tools to use and when
- ✅ **Deep Investigation**: Follows interesting leads wherever they go

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
cd /path/to/parleyapp/agent

# Ensure environment is set up
# backend/.env should have:
# - SUPABASE_URL
# - SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
# - XAI_API_KEY (or OPENAI_API_KEY)

# Ensure StatMuse API is running
# Should be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5001
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Generate 25 player prop picks for today
python run_props_agent.py

# Tomorrow's NHL props, 15 picks
python run_props_agent.py --tomorrow --sport NHL --picks 15

# Team betting analysis
python run_props_agent.py --team-bets --picks 10

# Deep investigation mode
python run_props_agent.py --investigate "Jose Altuve hits prop vs Yankees"
```

## 🧠 How It Works

### Architecture

```
User Command
    ↓
run_props_agent.py (50 lines - just a runner)
    ↓
EnhancedBettingAgent
    ↓
Autonomous ReAct Loop:
    1. THINK: "What do I need to know?"
    2. ACT: Use appropriate tool
    3. OBSERVE: "What did I learn?"
    4. ADAPT: "What should I do next?"
    ↓
Repeat until analysis complete
    ↓
Store predictions in database
```

### Available Tools

1. **supabase_betting** - Query games/props, store predictions
2. **statmuse_query** - Sports statistics and performance data
3. **web_search** - Real-time news, injuries, weather
4. **browser_use** - Navigate authoritative sites directly
5. **crawl4ai** - Extract content from multiple URLs
6. **planning** - Organize complex multi-step research

The agent **autonomously decides** which tools to use and when!

## 🎓 Prompt Engineering Techniques Applied

### 1. ReAct (Reason + Act)
```
Agent: "I need to check available props..."
→ Uses supabase_betting tool
→ "Interesting! These odds look mispriced..."
→ Uses statmuse_query for validation
→ "Confirmed! Strong value here..."
```

### 2. Chain-of-Thought
```
Agent: "Let me think step-by-step...
1. First, I need to see what games are available
2. Then identify props with potential value
3. For each candidate, validate with data
4. Finally, calculate true edge and store picks"
```

### 3. Planning Tool Integration
```python
# For complex analysis
agent.planning(
    command="create",
    plan_id="props_analysis",
    steps=["Survey props", "Research top 10", "Store picks"]
)
```

### 4. Adaptive Behavior
```
Agent discovers injury → Investigates impact
Agent sees line movement → Researches cause
Agent finds hot streak → Validates matchup
```

python run_props_agent.py --team-bets --picks 15
```

**Afternoon (2 PM)** - Player Props
```bash
python run_props_agent.py --picks 25

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Finding Games
```bash
# Issue: "No games found"
# Fix: Check that games exist with start_time >= NOW
```

### StatMuse Connection Errors
```bash
# Issue: StatMuse queries failing
# Fix: Ensure API running on localhost:5001
curl http://127.0.0.1:5001/health
```

### Predictions Not Stored
```bash
# Issue: Database insertion failures
# Fix: Verify Supabase credentials and table schema
```

### Agent Uses Too Many Steps
```bash
# Issue: Hits max_steps limit (75)
# Fix: Reduce --picks count or increase max_steps in config
```
