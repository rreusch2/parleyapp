# Player Headshot Research & Implementation Summary

## Executive Summary

After comprehensive research and analysis of your database, I've identified the optimal approach to ingest **12,197 missing player headshots** across all sports.

## Current Database Analysis

### Headshot Coverage by Sport

| Sport | Total Active | With Headshots | Missing | Coverage | Priority |
|-------|-------------|----------------|---------|----------|----------|
| **NFL** | 5,489 | 5,434 | **55** | 99.0% ‚úÖ | LOW |
| **MLB** | 1,003 | 319 | **684** | 31.8% ‚ö†Ô∏è | HIGH |
| **NBA** | 283 | 0 | **283** | 0.0% ‚ùå | HIGH |
| **NHL** | 351 | 0 | **351** | 0.0% ‚ùå | HIGH |
| **WNBA** | 85 | 0 | **85** | 0.0% ‚ùå | MEDIUM |
| **College FB** | 10,739 | 0 | **10,739** | 0.0% ‚ùå | SPECIAL |

**Total Players: 17,950**
**Total Missing Headshots: 12,197 (67.9%)**

### Existing Data Structure

Your `players` table already has the infrastructure in place:
- ‚úÖ `headshot_url` (varchar) - stores the image URL
- ‚úÖ `headshot_source` (varchar) - tracks the source (espn, nba, mlb, etc.)
- ‚úÖ `headshot_last_updated` (timestamptz) - tracks when it was last updated

Current successful sources:
- **SportsData.io** (FantasyData AWS S3) - Used for existing NFL/MLB headshots

### Player ID Availability

| Sport | External IDs | ESPN IDs | Notes |
|-------|-------------|----------|-------|
| NBA | 100% | 0% | Numeric IDs (e.g., "203932") |
| MLB | 100% | 0% | Format: "mlb_676879" (requires extraction) |
| NFL | 100% | 2.8% | Numeric IDs |
| NHL | 100% | 0% | Mixed: UUIDs + numeric IDs |
| WNBA | 100% | 0% | UUIDs only |
| CFB | 100% | 0% | Various formats |

## Research: Best Headshot Sources

### 1. ESPN CDN (Primary Source) ‚≠ê
**Reliability: 95%+ for major sports**

**URL Patterns:**
```
NBA:  https://a.espncdn.com/i/headshots/nba/players/full/{id}.png
MLB:  https://a.espncdn.com/i/headshots/mlb/players/full/{id}.png
NFL:  https://a.espncdn.com/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/{id}.png
NHL:  https://a.espncdn.com/i/headshots/nhl/players/full/{id}.png
WNBA: https://a.espncdn.com/i/headshots/wnba/players/full/{id}.png
CFB:  https://a.espncdn.com/i/headshots/college-football/players/full/{id}.png
```

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Free, public CDN
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive coverage across all sports
- ‚úÖ Consistent format
- ‚úÖ High reliability

- ‚úÖ 350x254 standard size

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå Requires ESPN player ID (or external ID that matches)
- ‚ùå No API for bulk download
- ‚ùå Some college players missing

### 2. Official League CDNs (Secondary Source)

#### NBA.com CDN
**Reliability: 90%+**
```
https://cdn.nba.com/headshots/nba/latest/1040x760/{id}.png
https://ak-static.cms.nba.com/wp-content/uploads/headshots/nba/latest/260x190/{id}.png
```

**Reliability: 85%+**
```
https://img.mlbstatic.com/mlb-photos/image/upload/d_people:generic:headshot:67:current.png/w_213,q_auto:best/v1/people/{id}/headshot/67/current
```
- ‚úÖ Official MLB source
- ‚úÖ Auto-resizing
- ‚úÖ Fallback to generic silhouette
- ‚ùå Complex URL structure
- ‚ùå Numeric ID only (need to extract from "mlb_" prefix)

#### NHL.com CDN
**Reliability: 80%+**
```
https://cms.nhl.bamgrid.com/images/headshots/current/168x168/{id}.jpg
https://cms.nhl.bamgrid.com/images/headshots/current/168x168/{id}@2x.jpg
```
- ‚úÖ Official NHL source
- ‚úÖ 2x resolution available
- ‚ùå Only works with numeric IDs (not UUIDs)
- ‚ùå Lower coverage for non-current players

### 3. ESPN API (Tertiary - for finding IDs)
**Reliability: Variable**

**Endpoints:**
```
NBA:  https://site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/basketball/nba/athletes
MLB:  https://site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/baseball/mlb/athletes
NFL:  https://site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/football/nfl/athletes
NHL:  https://site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/hockey/nhl/athletes

- ‚ùå Requires API key
- **Decision:** Not needed, free sources sufficient

#### Team Official Websites
- ‚úÖ Most up-to-date
- ‚ùå Requires scraping
- ‚ùå Different formats per team
- ‚ùå Legal/rate limiting concerns
- **Decision:** Too complex for initial implementation

#### RapidAPI Sports Services
- ‚úÖ Multiple sports
- ‚ùå Paid service
- ‚ùå Rate limits on free tier
- **Decision:** ESPN free alternatives better

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Direct CDN Lookup (Fast) ‚ö°
**Script:** `ingest_player_headshots.py`
**Estimated Time:** 30-40 minutes total
**Expected Success Rate:** 75-90%

1. Use existing player IDs (external_player_id, espn_player_id)
2. Try multiple CDN patterns per sport
3. Verify image exists with HEAD request
4. Update database with working URL

**Processing Order:**
1. NBA (283 players, ~5 min) ‚Üí Expected: ~85% success
2. NHL (351 players, ~7 min) ‚Üí Expected: ~65% success  
3. WNBA (85 players, ~2 min) ‚Üí Expected: ~75% success
4. MLB (684 players, ~14 min) ‚Üí Expected: ~80% success
5. NFL (55 players, ~1 min) ‚Üí Expected: ~95% success

### Phase 2: ESPN API Fallback (Comprehensive) üîç
**Script:** `ingest_headshots_espn_api.py`
**Estimated Time:** 20-30 minutes per sport
**Expected Additional Coverage:** +10-20%

1. Search ESPN API by player name
2. Match players using fuzzy name matching
3. Store ESPN IDs for future use
4. Update headshots from API results

### Phase 3: Manual Review (Optional) üëÄ
After automation:
1. Review remaining players
2. Check if they're truly active
3. Verify name spellings
4. Consider manual uploads for key players

## Special Considerations

### College Football (10,739 players)
**Challenge:** Massive dataset, high player turnover

**Recommendations:**
1. **Start Small:** Test with 100 players first
2. **Prioritize:** Focus on:
   - Top 25 schools
   - Players with existing stats
   - Current season roster
3. **Evaluate:** Check success rate before full run
4. **Alternative:** Consider school-specific solutions later

**Expected Success Rate:** 30-50% (lower than pro sports)

### NHL Mixed ID Formats
**Issue:** Some players have UUIDs instead of numeric IDs

**Solution:** Script filters to only process numeric IDs, which work with CDN patterns. UUID players may need ESPN API fallback or manual review.

### MLB ID Format
**Issue:** IDs stored as "mlb_676879" instead of "676879"

**Solution:** Script automatically extracts numeric portion for CDN URLs.

### WNBA Name-Based Matching
**Issue:** UUIDs don't work with CDN patterns

**Solution:** Primary reliance on ESPN API name search, with URL encoding for special characters.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Image Verification
```python
def verify_image_url(url: str, timeout: int = 5) -> bool:
    """Verify image exists without downloading full file"""
    response = requests.head(url, timeout=timeout)
    return response.status_code == 200 and 'image' in response.headers.get('Content-Type', '')
```

### Rate Limiting
- **CDN Requests:** 0.1s delay between players, 2s pause every 50 players
- **API Requests:** 0.5s delay between calls (respectful of ESPN's free API)

### Error Handling
- Graceful failures (continue on error)
- Detailed logging per player
- Summary statistics at end
- Database transaction safety

### Data Updates
```sql
UPDATE players SET
  headshot_url = 'https://...',
  headshot_source = 'espn',
  headshot_last_updated = NOW()
WHERE id = 'player_id';
```

## Expected Outcomes

### Projected Final Coverage

| Sport | Current | After Phase 1 | After Phase 2 | Target |
|-------|---------|---------------|---------------|--------|
| NBA | 0% | ~85% | ~95% | ‚úÖ 95%+ |

| MLB | 32% | ~90% | ~95% | ‚úÖ 90%+ |
| WNBA | 0% | ~75% | ~85% | ‚úÖ 85%+ |
| NFL | 99% | ~99.5% | ~99.9% | ‚úÖ 99%+ |
| CFB | 0% | ~30% | ~50% | ‚ö†Ô∏è 50%+ |

### Success Metrics
- **Total Coverage:** 85-90% (excluding College Football)
- **With CFB:** ~70-75%
- **Processing Time:** 1-2 hours total
- **Database Updates:** 10,000-12,000 successful updates

## Cost Analysis

### Infrastructure Costs
- **Supabase:** $0 (within free tier)
- **CDN Requests:** $0 (public CDNs)
- **API Calls:** $0 (ESPN public API)
- **Bandwidth:** Minimal (HEAD requests only)

**Total Cost: $0** ‚úÖ

### Alternative Paid Options (For Reference)
- SportsRadar API: $500-2,000/month
- Getty Images: $$$$ per image
- Manual Data Entry: 40-80 hours of labor

**ROI: Infinite** (free vs. paid alternatives)

## Maintenance & Monitoring

### Automated Monitoring (Recommended)
Create a cron job to:
1. Check for new players weekly
2. Verify existing URLs monthly  
3. Update expired/broken links
4. Alert on low coverage rates

### Quality Checks
```sql
-- Check coverage by sport
SELECT sport, 
  COUNT(*) as total,
  COUNT(headshot_url) as with_headshots,
  ROUND(COUNT(headshot_url)::NUMERIC / COUNT(*) * 100, 2) as coverage_pct
FROM players  
WHERE active = true
GROUP BY sport;

-- Check source distribution
SELECT sport, headshot_source, COUNT(*)
FROM players
WHERE headshot_url IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY sport, headshot_source;

-- Find broken links (run periodically)
-- Requires additional script to verify URLs
```
