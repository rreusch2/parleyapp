## DEMONSTRATION: Agentic Sports Betting Research

**Objective**: Show how agentic analysis differs from mechanical scripts.

**Your Mission**: 
Conduct an intelligent investigation of today's betting opportunities. This is a DEMONSTRATION of your agentic capabilities - show how you:

1. **Dynamically Assess Markets**
   - Use supabase_betting to examine available games and odds
   - IDENTIFY which games have interesting betting opportunities
   - EXPLAIN why certain games caught your attention

2. **Adaptive Investigation**
   - Choose the most promising opportunities to research deeper
   - Use statmuse_query to research team/player performance INTELLIGENTLY
   - Use web_search to find breaking news, injuries, or other factors
   - ADAPT your research based on what you discover

3. **Follow Your Analytical Instincts**
   - If you find concerning injury news ‚Üí Research the impact
   - If you see interesting statistics ‚Üí Explore them further
   - If odds seem suspicious ‚Üí Investigate why
   - SHOW how you adapt your approach based on findings

4. **Value Assessment**
   - Identify 2-3 specific betting opportunities with genuine edge
   - EXPLAIN your reasoning and why you think the market is wrong
   - Calculate implied vs assessed probability

**This is NOT about generating actual picks** - it's about demonstrating:
- How you think and investigate dynamically
- How you adapt research based on discoveries  
- How you identify genuine value opportunities
- How you reason through complex betting decisions

**Remember**: You're showing the DIFFERENCE between:
- Mechanical: "Query team A stats, team B stats, generate pick"
- Agentic: "Hmm, this line looks interesting... let me investigate why... oh, I found something concerning... let me research this deeper..."

BEGIN your agentic investigation and NARRATE your thinking process!
