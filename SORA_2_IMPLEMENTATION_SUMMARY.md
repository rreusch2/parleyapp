## 🔑 Setup Required

### 1. OpenAI API Key (CRITICAL)

You need an OpenAI API key with Sora 2 access.

**Get your key:**
1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Create new key
3. Add to Railway environment variables:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
   ```

**Note**: Sora 2 is in limited preview. You may need to:
- Be on a paid OpenAI tier (Tier 1+)
- Request access to Sora 2
- Check https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/sora-2 for availability

### 2. Package Installation

Already done! But if you need to reinstall:
```bash
# Backend
cd backend
npm install openai@latest

# Frontend  
cd ..
npm install expo-av expo-file-system expo-media-library expo-sharing
```

### 3. Railway Deployment

After adding OPENAI_API_KEY to Railway:
```bash
# Deploy will happen automatically when you push to GitHub
# Or manually trigger redeploy in Railway dashboard
```

## 🎨 Video Examples

Lakers vs Warriors: Lakers -5.5 @ -110.

**Result**:

## 💸 Cost Analysis

### Per Video Cost:
- 5 seconds @ $0.10/sec = **$0.50 per video**
- 10 seconds @ $0.10/sec = **$1.00 per video**

### Monthly Cost Estimates:

#### Free Tier (1 video/day):
- 30 videos/month × $0.50 = **$15/month**
- **Revenue**: $0 (free users)
- **Net cost**: -$15/month per free user

#### Pro Tier (5 videos/day max):
- Avg 3 videos/day × 30 days × $0.50 = **$45/month**
- **Revenue**: $24.99/month (Pro subscription)
- **Net**: -$20/month (cost to acquire/retain)

#### Elite Tier (unlimited):
- Avg 10 videos/day × 30 days × $0.50 = **$150/month**
- **Revenue**: $29.99/month (Elite subscription)  
- **Net**: -$120/month

### Profitability Strategy:
1. **Free tier cost** justifies as customer acquisition
2. **Pro/Elite** - could increase pricing or add "Video Add-On"
3. **Alternative**: Charge per video (1 coin = 1 video)
4. **Best**: Use as premium feature to drive upgrades, monitor actual usage

### Cost Mitigation:
- Users likely won't max out daily limits
- Many will forget/not use feature daily
- Could add 5-video/week limit instead of daily
- Elite could be "10 videos/day" not unlimited

  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${OPENAI_API_KEY}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',

## 💎 Why This Is Worth The Cost

Even though each video costs $0.50:

1. **Customer Acquisition**: $15/month to acquire a free user is CHEAP (typical CAC is $50-200)
2. **Conversion**: Free users hitting limit → 20%+ upgrade rate = $5 LTV increase
3. **Retention**: Sticky feature keeps users coming back
4. **Marketing**: Each shared video = free ad worth $5-10 in reach
5. **Differentiation**: Unique feature justifies premium pricing

**ROI Calculation**:
- Cost: $50/month for 100 free users creating videos
- Conversions: 20 users upgrade to Pro = $499 revenue
- **Net profit**: $449/month

Plus unmeasurable brand value and social reach!
