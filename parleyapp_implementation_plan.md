ParleyApp AI System Implementation Plan 

This document outlines a comprehensive implementation plan to enhance the ParleyApp's AI system, addressing current limitations and building a robust, data driven sports betting application. The plan is structured into four phases, each with specific objectives, detailed tasks, and estimated timelines. 

Phase 1: Data Layer Foundation 

Objective: Establish a robust and reliable data ingestion pipeline with real-time and historical sports data. 

Estimated Timeline: 4-6 weeks 

Detailed Tasks: 

1\. API Selection and Procurement (Week 1) 

Task: Finalize the choice between OddsJam and The Odds API. (OddsJam is recommended for its comprehensive features including real-time player props, alternate markets, injury data, and historical odds). 

Action: Research pricing, terms of service, and API documentation for both. Secure necessary API keys and credentials. 

Responsible: Development Lead / Project Manager 

2\. Database Schema Design and Setup (Weeks 1-2) 

Task: Design a scalable PostgreSQL database schema to accommodate various sports, leagues, betting markets, player-specific data, game events, odds, and injury reports. 

Action: Create tables, define relationships, and implement indexing strategies for efficient data retrieval. Set up the PostgreSQL instance (if not  
already in place) and configure access. 

Responsible: Database Administrator / Backend Developer 

3\. Data Ingestion Microservice Development (Weeks 2-5) 

Task: Develop a dedicated Python microservice (e.g., data\_ingestor.py ) responsible for connecting to the chosen sports data API and ingesting data. 

Action: 

Implement API client for the selected sports data provider. 

Develop modules for fetching real-time odds (spread, total, 

moneyline, player props), historical odds, player statistics, team statistics, game information, and injury reports. 

Implement data validation, cleaning, and transformation logic to ensure data quality and consistency before storage. 

Write code to store processed data into the PostgreSQL database. 

Implement error handling, logging, and retry mechanisms for API calls and database operations. 

Responsible: Backend Developer / Data Engineer 

4\. Historical Data Backfill (Weeks 4-6) 

Task: Ingest a significant volume of historical data from the chosen API to build a comprehensive dataset for model training and backtesting. 

Action: Develop a script within the data\_ingestor service to perform a one-time (or iterative) backfill of historical data. Monitor progress and ensure data integrity. 

Responsible: Data Engineer 

5\. Data Ingestion Monitoring and Alerting (Week 6) 

Task: Implement monitoring and alerting for the data ingestion pipeline. 

Action: Set up dashboards to track data freshness, API call success rates, and data volume. Configure alerts for any data ingestion failures or anomalies. 

Responsible: DevOps / Backend Developer
