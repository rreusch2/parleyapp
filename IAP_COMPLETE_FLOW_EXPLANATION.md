# 🎯 **COMPLETE IAP FLOW - HOW IT ALL WORKS**

## ✅ **WHAT'S NOW COMPLETE**

Your IAP system is **FULLY FUNCTIONAL** for production! Here's the complete flow:

---

## 🔄 **SUBSCRIPTION LIFECYCLE**

### **1. Initial Purchase** ✅
```
User taps "Subscribe" → iOS/Android purchase flow → Receipt sent to your backend
```

**What happens:**
1. User selects Monthly ($24.99), Yearly ($199.99), or Lifetime ($349.99)
2. Apple/Google processes payment
3. Your app calls `/api/purchases/verify` with receipt
4. Backend verifies with Apple/Google servers
5. **Database updated:**
   - `subscription_tier`: `free` → `pro_monthly`/`pro_yearly`/`pro_lifetime`
   - `subscription_status`: `inactive` → `active`
   - `apple_receipt_data`: populated with receipt
   - `subscription_expires_at`: set (except lifetime)

### **2. User Gets Pro Access** ✅
```
subscription_tier = "pro_monthly" → User can access all Pro features
```

### **3. Apple Auto-Billing** ✅
```
Apple automatically charges user monthly/yearly (you don't handle this)
```

### **4. Renewal Webhook** ✅
```
Apple → Your webhook → Database updated with new expiry date
```

**What happens:**
1. Apple automatically renews subscription
2. Apple sends webhook to `/api/webhooks/apple`
3. Your backend processes `DID_RENEW` notification
4. **Database updated:**
   - `subscription_expires_at`: extended for another month/year
   - `subscription_status`: remains `active`

### **5. User Cancellation** ✅
```
User cancels in App Store → Webhook → Marked as cancelled but stays active until expiry
```

**What happens:**
1. User cancels in iOS Settings → App Store → Subscriptions
2. Apple sends `DID_CANCEL` webhook
3. **Database updated:**
   - `subscription_status`: `active` → `cancelled`
   - `subscription_expires_at`: unchanged (still active until this date)
4. User keeps Pro access until expiration date

### **6. Subscription Expires** ✅
```
Expiry date passes → Automatic checker → User downgraded to free
```

**What happens:**
1. **Automatic checker runs every hour** (now implemented)
2. Finds users where `subscription_expires_at < now()`
3. **Database updated:**
   - `subscription_tier`: `pro_monthly` → `free`
   - `subscription_status`: `cancelled` → `expired`
   - `subscription_expires_at`: null

### **7. Payment Failures** ✅
```
Apple can't charge → Webhook → Status marked as past_due
```

**What happens:**
1. Apple fails to charge user (expired card, etc.)
2. Apple sends `DID_FAIL_TO_RENEW` webhook
3. **Database updated:**
   - `subscription_status`: `active` → `past_due`
4. User keeps access temporarily while Apple retries

### **8. Refunds** ✅
```
Apple processes refund → Webhook → User immediately downgraded
```

**What happens:**
1. Apple processes refund
2. Apple sends `REFUND` webhook
3. **Database updated:**
   - `subscription_tier`: `pro_monthly` → `free`
   - `subscription_status`: `active` → `refunded`
   - `subscription_expires_at`: null

---

## 🏆 **LIFETIME PRO** ✅

### **How it works:**
1. User pays $349.99 once
2. **Database updated:**
   - `subscription_tier`: `free` → `pro_lifetime`
   - `subscription_status`: `inactive` → `active`
   - `subscription_expires_at`: **NULL** (never expires)
3. User has Pro access **forever**
4. No renewals, no webhooks needed

---

## 🔍 **USER STATUS CHECKING**

### **Frontend Service** ✅
Your app can check user status:
```typescript
import { subscriptionChecker } from './services/subscriptionChecker';

// Check if user is Pro
const isPro = await subscriptionChecker.isPro();

// Get detailed status
const status = await subscriptionChecker.getSubscriptionStatus();
// Returns: { isActive, isPro, tier, daysRemaining, etc. }
```

### **Backend API** ✅
Frontend can call: `GET /api/purchases/status`
```json
{
  "isActive": true,
  "isPro": true,
  "tier": "pro_monthly",
  "status": "active",
  "expiresAt": "2025-02-11T20:22:58.000Z",
  "daysRemaining": 31,
  "isLifetime": false
}
```
