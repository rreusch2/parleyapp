## Todo List for n8n RAG Workflow Integration

### Phase 1: Analyze the n8n RAG workflow and identify exposure points
- [x] Analyze the 'Load Data Flow' to understand its function and potential for external triggering.
- [x] Analyze the 'Retriever Flow' to understand its input (chat message) and output (AI Agent response).
- [x] Identify how the 'Query Data Tool' interacts with the embeddings.

### Phase 2: Propose methods to expose the n8n RAG workflow as an API/webhook
- [x] Research n8n's capabilities for exposing workflows as webhooks or APIs.
- [x] Propose a method for triggering the 'Retriever Flow' externally.
- [x] Propose a method for triggering the 'Load Data Flow' externally (for data ingestion).

### Phase 3: Define the input/output schema for the RAG tool
- [x] Define the input parameters required for the RAG tool (e.g., user query, context).
- [x] Define the expected output format from the RAG tool (e.g., retrieved documents, AI-generated response).

### Phase 4: Outline how AI systems (Grok/Professor Lock) would use the RAG tool
- [x] Describe how Grok would be prompted to use the RAG tool.
- [x] Explain the process of passing user queries to the RAG tool and integrating its response.
- [x] Discuss how the RAG tool would enhance Professor Lock's capabilities.

### Phase 5: Deliver comprehensive plan and recommendations
- [ ] Compile all findings and recommendations into a comprehensive report.
- [ ] Provide a high-level architectural diagram illustrating the integration.
- [ ] Deliver the report to the user.
