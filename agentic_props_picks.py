Agentic Player Props Picks Generator  
Replaces the mechanical props_enhanced.py with truly agentic analysis using OpenManus

This script uses the OpenManus BettingAgent to:
1. Dynamically research available player props and betting opportunities
2. Conduct intelligent player and matchup analysis based on findings
3. Generate profitable player prop picks across all sports
4. Store picks in the ai_predictions table in the exact format expected

Usage:
    python agentic_props_picks.py [--date YYYY-MM-DD] [--picks N] [--sport SPORT] [--verbose]

Examples:
    python agentic_props_picks.py                                   # Today, 15 picks
    python agentic_props_picks.py --date 2025-09-23 --picks 25     # Specific date, 25 picks  
    python agentic_props_picks.py --sport MLB --picks 12           # MLB only, 12 picks

## AGENTIC PLAYER PROPS ANALYSIS MISSION

{sport_context}Generate {target_picks} profitable PLAYER PROP picks for {target_date or 'today'}.

**CRITICAL AGENTIC APPROACH**: 
You are conducting genuine investigative analysis, not following a script. Be adaptive, curious, and let your discoveries guide your research path.

**Your Dynamic Research Process:**

1. **Props Market Survey**
   - Use supabase_betting to examine available player props across sports
   - Identify props with interesting lines, favorable matchups, or value opportunities
   - Note which players/props deserve deeper investigation

2. **Player & Matchup Investigation**
   - For promising props, conduct deep research using:
     * statmuse_query: Player recent performance, season stats, historical vs opponent
     * web_search: Injury news, lineup changes, usage updates, matchup analysis
   - Follow interesting leads - if a player has been hot lately, research why
   - If you see concerning injury/usage news, investigate the impact
   - Adapt your strategy based on what you discover

3. **Value Assessment & Selection**
   - Calculate implied probability vs your player performance assessment
   - Consider recent form vs season averages (recent form often more predictive)
   - Factor in matchup advantages and situational factors
   - Select props where you have genuine analytical edge

4. **Quality Control & Storage**
   - Generate ONLY props with clear value and reasoning
   - Ensure odds exist for your recommendation (verify over/under availability)
   - Never select impossible props (e.g., "Under 0.5" Home Runs/Stolen Bases)
   - Store using supabase_betting with detailed analysis

**Sport-Specific Focus Areas:**

**MLB Props to Consider:**
- Batter Hits O/U (analyze vs pitcher matchup, recent form)
- Home Runs O/U (park factors, pitcher tendencies, player power)  
- RBIs O/U (lineup position, runners scoring opportunities)
- Total Bases O/U (contact vs power hitters, ballpark factors)
- Pitcher Strikeouts O/U (swinging strike rates, opponent strikeout rates)
- Runs Scored O/U (leadoff/top of order opportunities)

**WNBA Props to Consider:**
- Points O/U (usage rate, recent scoring, matchup pace)
- Rebounds O/U (opponent rebounding rates, player positioning)
- Assists O/U (team pace, ball-handling role, teammate shooting)
- Three-Pointers O/U (shot attempts, recent accuracy, defensive matchup)

**NFL Props to Consider:**
- Passing Yards O/U (weather, opponent pass defense, game script)
- Rushing Yards O/U (opponent run defense, game flow, usage)
- Receiving Yards O/U (target share, opponent coverage, matchup)
- Touchdowns O/U (red zone usage, scoring opportunities)

**CFB Props to Consider:**
- Similar to NFL but consider college game pace and style differences

**Investigation Guidelines:**
- Recent player form (last 10-15 games) often more important than season averages
- Check for injury reports and usage changes that could impact performance
- Analyze opponent defensive rankings vs specific statistical categories
- Consider game pace, weather (outdoor sports), and motivational factors
- Look for props where market hasn't adjusted to recent trends

**Critical Quality Standards:**
- Each prop must have clear analytical reasoning and edge identification
- Confidence levels should be realistic (55-75% range typically)
- Avoid "lottery ticket" props with extreme odds unless exceptional value
- Diversify across sports, prop types, and players
- Include detailed reasoning explaining why market may be mispriced

**Research Depth Requirements:**
- Use statmuse_query to research player recent performance vs historical
- Use web_search to check for injury/lineup news that could impact player
- Follow up on interesting statistical trends or matchup advantages you discover
- Be genuinely investigative - if something seems interesting, explore it deeper

START by examining available player props, then let your analytical curiosity guide your research!
