## Implementation Details

### 1. Python AI Scripts - Risk-Stratified Generation

**Files Modified:**
- `/home/reid/Desktop/parleyapp/props_enhanced.py`
- `/home/reid/Desktop/parleyapp/teams_enhanced.py`
- `/home/reid/Desktop/parleyapp/daily-automation-new.sh`

**Pick Generation Scaled Up:**
- **Previous**: 15 props + 10 teams = 25 total picks
- **New**: 25 props + 25 teams = **50 total picks daily**
- **Reason**: Ensures Elite tier users get 30+ picks regardless of betting style

**Changes Made:**

#### Enhanced AI Prompts
Added explicit risk stratification requirements to Grok prompts:

```
üéØ **CRITICAL: RISK-STRATIFIED PICK GENERATION**

You MUST generate picks across 3 DISTINCT risk categories:

**CONSERVATIVE PICKS (~35% of total):**
- Target odds: -200 to -110 (heavy favorites, safer bets)
- Confidence range: 70-85% 
- Risk level tag: "Low"
- Example: Star player vs weak pitcher, home team ML favorite

**BALANCED PICKS (~50% of total):**
- Target odds: -150 to +150 (slight favorites to underdogs)
- Confidence range: 60-75%
- Risk level tag: "Medium"
- Example: Quality matchup with statistical edge

**AGGRESSIVE PICKS (~15% of total):**
- Target odds: +120 to +300 (underdogs with value)
- Confidence range: 55-70%
- Risk level tag: "High"
- Example: Underdog with hidden edge, contrarian play
```

#### Updated JSON Response Format
Added required `risk_level` field to all AI-generated picks:

```json
{
  "player_name": "Player Name",
  "odds": -150,
  "confidence": 65,
  "risk_level": "Medium",  // ‚Üê NEW REQUIRED FIELD
  "reasoning": "...",
  ...
}
```

#### Improved Risk Level Assignment
Enhanced fallback logic if AI doesn't provide risk_level:

```python
# Get risk level from AI (preferred) or determine from confidence as fallback
risk_level = pred.get("risk_level")
if not risk_level:
    confidence = pred.get("confidence", 75)
    odds = pred.get("odds", 0)
    
    # Determine risk based on confidence AND odds alignment
    if confidence >= 70 and odds <= -110:
        risk_level = "Low"  # Conservative: high confidence + favorite odds
    elif confidence >= 60 and -150 <= odds <= 150:
        risk_level = "Medium"  # Balanced: good confidence + reasonable odds
    else:
        risk_level = "High"  # Aggressive: lower confidence or underdog odds
```

**Target Daily Distribution (for 50 total picks):**

**Props (25 picks):**
- Conservative (Low risk): ~9 picks (36%)
- Balanced (Medium risk): ~13 picks (52%)
- Aggressive (High risk): ~3 picks (12%)

**Teams (25 picks):**
- Conservative (Low risk): ~9 picks (36%)
- Balanced (Medium risk): ~13 picks (52%)
- Aggressive (High risk): ~3 picks (12%)

**Combined Pool:**
- **18 Low risk picks** ‚Üí Elite Conservative users get 30 picks ‚úÖ
- **26 Medium risk picks** ‚Üí Elite Balanced users get 30+ picks ‚úÖ
- **6 High risk picks** ‚Üí Elite Aggressive users get full spectrum ‚úÖ

---

### 2. Backend API - Betting Style Filtering

**File Modified:**
- `/home/reid/Desktop/parleyapp/backend/src/api/routes/ai.ts`

**Endpoint Updated:**
- `GET /api/ai/daily-picks-combined`

**Changes Made:**

#### Added User Betting Style Lookup
```typescript
// Get user's betting style preference from profiles table
let bettingStyle = 'balanced'; // Default
let allowedRiskLevels: string[] = ['Low', 'Medium']; // Default for balanced

if (userId) {
  const { data: profile } = await supabaseAdmin
    .from('profiles')
    .select('betting_style')
    .eq('id', userId)
    .single();
  
  if (profile) {
    bettingStyle = profile.betting_style || 'balanced';
    
    // Determine allowed risk levels based on betting style
    if (bettingStyle === 'conservative') {
      allowedRiskLevels = ['Low']; // Only safe picks
    } else if (bettingStyle === 'balanced') {
      allowedRiskLevels = ['Low', 'Medium']; // Safe + moderate picks
    } else if (bettingStyle === 'aggressive') {
      allowedRiskLevels = ['Low', 'Medium', 'High']; // All picks
    }
  }
}
```

#### Added Risk Level Filtering
```typescript
// Filter by risk level based on user's betting style
const teamFiltered = teamPool.filter(pick => {
  const riskLevel = pick.risk_level || 'Medium'; // Default to Medium if not set
  return allowedRiskLevels.includes(riskLevel);
});

const propsFiltered = propsPool.filter(pick => {
  const riskLevel = pick.risk_level || 'Medium'; // Default to Medium if not set
  return allowedRiskLevels.includes(riskLevel);
});

logger.info(`üîç Betting style filtering (${bettingStyle}): Teams ${teamPool.length} ‚Üí ${teamFiltered.length}, Props ${propsPool.length} ‚Üí ${propsFiltered.length}`);

// Now apply sport-aware limiting to filtered picks
const teamSelected = selectRoundRobin(teamFiltered, teamPicksLimit);
const propsSelected = selectRoundRobin(propsFiltered, playerPropsLimit);
```

---

## How It Works - Complete Flow

### Step 1: Daily AI Generation
Scripts run daily via automation (`daily-automation-new.sh`) with `--picks 25` flag:

1. **props_enhanced.py --picks 25** generates 25 player prop picks:
   - ~9 Conservative (Low risk, -200 to -110 odds, 70-85% confidence)
   - ~13 Balanced (Medium risk, -150 to +150 odds, 60-75% confidence)
   - ~3 Aggressive (High risk, +120 to +300 odds, 55-70% confidence)

2. **teams_enhanced.py --picks 25** generates 25 team picks with same distribution:
   - ~9 Conservative (Low risk)
   - ~13 Balanced (Medium risk)
   - ~3 Aggressive (High risk)

3. **Total Pool: 50 picks daily** (18 Low + 26 Medium + 6 High risk)
4. All picks stored in `ai_predictions` table with `risk_level` column populated

**Quality Controls:**
- AI instructed to only generate picks with clear value/edge
- Better to return fewer high-quality picks than force the 25 target
- Minimum thresholds enforced: confidence, value %, and odds ranges
- Dynamic scaling based on available games (fewer games = fewer picks)

### Step 2: User Requests Picks
User opens app ‚Üí Frontend calls `/api/ai/daily-picks-combined?userId=X&userTier=Y`

### Step 3: Backend Filters by Betting Style

**Conservative User (346 users):**
- Only sees picks with `risk_level = 'Low'`
- Pool: 18 Low risk picks from 50 total
- Gets safer picks: -200 to -110 odds, 70-85% confidence
- Lower payouts but higher win rates
- Example: Free user gets 2 safest picks, Pro user gets 20 safest picks, **Elite user gets 30 picks** ‚úÖ

**Balanced User (1,429 users):**
- Sees picks with `risk_level IN ('Low', 'Medium')`
- Pool: 44 picks (18 Low + 26 Medium) from 50 total
- Gets mix of safe + value picks: -200 to +150 odds, 60-85% confidence
- Moderate risk/reward balance
- Example: Free user gets 2 best balanced picks, Pro user gets 20 balanced picks, **Elite user gets 30 picks** ‚úÖ

**Aggressive User (196 users):**
- Sees ALL picks including `risk_level = 'High'`
- Pool: All 50 picks (18 Low + 26 Medium + 6 High)
- Gets full spectrum: -200 to +300 odds, 55-85% confidence
- Includes high-risk/high-reward underdogs
- Example: Free user gets 2 best picks from all levels, Pro user gets 20 picks, **Elite user gets 30 picks** ‚úÖ

### Step 4: Tier-Based Limits Applied
After filtering by betting style, apply subscription tier limits:

- **Free tier**: 1 team + 1 prop = 2 total picks (from their risk level)
- **Pro tier**: 10 team + 10 props = 20 total picks (from their risk level)
- **Elite tier**: 15 team + 15 props = 30 total picks (from their risk level)

## Risk Level Definitions

### Low Risk (Conservative)
- **Odds Range**: -200 to -110
- **Confidence**: 70-85%
- **Win Rate**: High (~75%)
- **Payout**: Lower (returns less per bet)
- **Example**: Yankees ML -180 vs last-place team
- **User Type**: Risk-averse bettors who prioritize winning percentage

### Medium Risk (Balanced)
- **Odds Range**: -150 to +150
- **Confidence**: 60-75%
- **Win Rate**: Moderate (~65%)
- **Payout**: Moderate (balanced risk/reward)
- **Example**: Quality pitcher with slight favorable matchup at -130
- **User Type**: Value-seeking bettors who want profitable long-term edge

### High Risk (Aggressive)
- **Odds Range**: +120 to +300
- **Confidence**: 55-70%
- **Win Rate**: Lower (~60%)
- **Payout**: Higher (bigger returns when hit)
- **Example**: Underdog team with hidden advantage at +220
- **User Type**: Risk-tolerant bettors seeking bigger payouts

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Test AI Generation

Run the scripts manually to verify risk stratification:

```bash
cd /home/reid/Desktop/parleyapp

# Test player props generation
python props_enhanced.py --picks 15 --tomorrow

# Test team picks generation  
python teams_enhanced.py --picks 10 --tomorrow

# Check database for risk_level values
# Should see mix of "Low", "Medium", "High"
```

**Expected Output:**
- Props: ~5 Low, ~8 Medium, ~2 High risk picks
- Teams: ~4 Low, ~5 Balanced, ~1 High risk picks
- All picks have `risk_level` field populated in database

### 2. Test Backend Filtering

**Test Conservative User:**
```bash
# Create test user with conservative betting style
# Update profiles table: betting_style = 'conservative'

# Call API
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/ai/daily-picks-combined?userId=TEST_USER_ID&userTier=pro"

# Verify response only contains picks with risk_level = "Low"
```

**Test Balanced User:**
```bash
# Update profiles table: betting_style = 'balanced'

# Call API
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/ai/daily-picks-combined?userId=TEST_USER_ID&userTier=pro"

# Verify response contains picks with risk_level = "Low" OR "Medium"
```

**Test Aggressive User:**
```bash
# Update profiles table: betting_style = 'aggressive'

# Call API  
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/ai/daily-picks-combined?userId=TEST_USER_ID&userTier=pro"

# Verify response contains picks with ALL risk levels (Low, Medium, High)
```

### 3. Verify Database

Check that picks have proper risk_level distribution:

```sql
-- Check risk level distribution in latest picks
SELECT 
  risk_level,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (), 2) as percentage
FROM ai_predictions
WHERE created_at >= CURRENT_DATE
GROUP BY risk_level
ORDER BY risk_level;

-- Expected results (approximately):
-- Low: ~35% (7 picks)
-- Medium: ~50% (10 picks)  
-- High: ~15% (3 picks)
```

### 4. Test Frontend Integration

1. **Sign in as test user**
2. **Go to Settings** ‚Üí Change betting style preference
3. **Go to Picks tab** ‚Üí Verify picks match betting style:
   - Conservative: Should only see low-risk favorites
   - Balanced: Should see mix of favorites and moderate underdogs
   - Aggressive: Should see full spectrum including longshots
4. **Check pick details**: Verify odds ranges align with risk level
   - Conservative picks: Mostly -200 to -110
   - Balanced picks: Mix of -150 to +150
   - Aggressive picks: Include +120 to +300

## Monitoring & Optimization

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Pick Distribution in Database:**
   - Target: 35% Low, 50% Medium, 15% High
   - Monitor daily to ensure AI is following guidelines

2. **User Engagement by Betting Style:**
   - Do conservative users have higher app retention?
   - Do aggressive users hit more parlays?
   - Track win rates by betting style preference

3. **Filter Effectiveness:**
   - Log how many picks get filtered per user
   - Ensure conservative users aren't starved of picks
   - Verify aggressive users get full selection

4. **Backend Performance:**
   - Monitor query times for betting style filtering
   - Ensure filtering doesn't slow down API responses

### SQL Monitoring Queries

```sql
-- Daily pick distribution check
SELECT 
  DATE(created_at) as pick_date,
  risk_level,
  COUNT(*) as count
FROM ai_predictions
WHERE created_at >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY DATE(created_at), risk_level
ORDER BY pick_date DESC, risk_level;

-- User betting style distribution
SELECT 
  betting_style,
  COUNT(*) as user_count,
  ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER (), 2) as percentage
FROM profiles
WHERE betting_style IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY betting_style;

-- Picks per betting style (verify filtering works)
SELECT 
  p.betting_style,
  ap.risk_level,
  COUNT(*) as picks_shown
FROM profiles p
JOIN ai_predictions ap ON ap.user_id = p.id
WHERE ap.created_at >= CURRENT_DATE
GROUP BY p.betting_style, ap.risk_level
ORDER BY p.betting_style, ap.risk_level;
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: All picks showing same risk_level
**Cause**: AI not respecting risk stratification in prompt
**Fix**: Check Grok prompt includes risk level distribution requirements
**Verify**: Read props_enhanced.py/teams_enhanced.py prompts

### Issue: Conservative users getting no picks
**Cause**: Not enough Low risk picks being generated
**Fix**: Adjust AI prompt to generate more conservative picks (increase to 40%)
**Temporary**: Lower conservative user tier limits slightly

### Issue: risk_level field is null in database
**Cause**: Fallback logic not triggering or old picks
**Fix**: Ensure fallback logic in both Python scripts is working
**Quick Fix**: Run migration to set nulls to 'Medium'

```sql
-- Set all null risk_levels to Medium as default
UPDATE ai_predictions 
SET risk_level = 'Medium'
WHERE risk_level IS NULL;
```
