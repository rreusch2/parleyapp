# AI Trends Table Schema Implementation

## Overview
Successfully designed and implemented the Supabase schema for the `ai_trends` table as requested in Step 1 of the broader plan.

## Table Structure
The `ai_trends` table has been created with the following schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE public.ai_trends (
    id uuid NOT NULL DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id uuid NOT NULL,
    trend_text text NOT NULL,
    trend_type character varying NOT NULL CHECK (trend_type::text = ANY (ARRAY['player_prop'::character varying::text, 'team'::character varying::text])),
    sport character varying NOT NULL,
    confidence_score numeric NOT NULL CHECK (confidence_score >= 0 AND confidence_score <= 100),
    data jsonb,
    expires_at timestamp with time zone,
    created_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now(),
    updated_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT now(),
    CONSTRAINT ai_trends_pkey PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
```

## Indexes Added
Performance-optimized indexes have been created:

1. **idx_ai_trends_sport_trend_type_created_at** - Composite index on (sport, trend_type, created_at)
2. **idx_ai_trends_user_id** - Index on user_id for fast user-specific queries
3. **idx_ai_trends_expires_at** - Index on expires_at for efficient expiration filtering

## Row Level Security (RLS)
RLS has been enabled with policies matching the `ai_predictions` table:

- **Enable insert for authenticated users** - Allows authenticated users to insert records
- **Enable read access for all users** - Allows authenticated users to read all records

## Triggers
- **update_ai_trends_updated_at** - Automatically updates the `updated_at` timestamp on record updates

## Constraints
- **trend_type** - Must be either 'player_prop' or 'team'
- **confidence_score** - Must be between 0 and 100 (inclusive)
- All required fields have NOT NULL constraints

## Migration Status
- Migration name: `create_ai_trends_table`
- Migration version: `20250804121422`
- Status: Successfully applied

## Documentation Update
The `/mostrecentsupabase.sql` file has been updated to include the new `ai_trends` table definition.

## Testing
- Table creation: ✅ Complete
- Constraints validation: ✅ Complete
- Index creation: ✅ Complete
- RLS policies: ✅ Complete
- Insert/Delete operations: ✅ Tested successfully

## Next Steps
The `ai_trends` table is ready for use by AI systems to store and retrieve trend data with proper performance optimization and security controls in place.
