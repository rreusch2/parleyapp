# NHL Support - Complete Implementation for teams_enhanced.py

## Problem
When running `python teams_enhanced.py --tomorrow --sport NHL`, the script was:
1. ‚ùå Rejecting NHL as invalid sport choice
2. ‚ùå Still fetching MLB, CFB, and other sports instead of ONLY NHL
3. ‚ùå AI was researching baseball and college football instead of hockey

## Solution: "Prompt Engineered to the MAX" üèí

### 1. Added NHL to Sport Filter Mapping (Line 1953)
```python
sport_map = {
    'NFL': 'National Football League',
    'NHL': 'National Hockey League',  # ‚Üê ADDED
    'MLB': 'Major League Baseball',
    # ...
}
```

### 2. Added NHL-Only Mode Flag (Lines 1968-1972)
```python
elif args.sport.upper() == 'NHL':
    # Enable NHL-only mode for focused hockey analysis
    agent.nhl_only_mode = True
    setattr(agent.db, 'nhl_only_mode', True)
    logger.info(f"üèí NHL-only mode enabled for focused hockey analysis")
```

### 3. NHL-Exclusive Research Focus (Lines 906-914)
```python
if hasattr(self, 'nhl_only_mode') and self.nhl_only_mode:
    # NHL-ONLY MODE: Focus EXCLUSIVELY on hockey
    nhl_game_count = len([g for g in games if g.get('sport') == 'National Hockey League'])
    sport_info = f"NHL Games: {nhl_game_count}"
    research_focus = "NHL"
    target_nhl_queries = target_picks * 2  # More research for better picks
    sport_queries_text = f"""- **NHL Team Research**: {target_nhl_queries} different teams/matchups (for {target_picks} final picks)"""
    web_searches_text = f"**Web Searches**: {min(6, target_picks)} total (NHL injury/lineup/weather/goalie confirmations)"
    task_focus = f"**NHL EXCLUSIVE**: Research {target_nhl_queries} DIFFERENT NHL teams/matchups (variety of divisions, home/away, goalie matchups, recent form)"
```

### 4. NHL-Specific StatMuse Examples (Lines 987-994)
**AI now sees ONLY hockey examples:**
```python
'''- "Toronto Maple Leafs record vs Boston Bruins this season"
- "Edmonton Oilers home record last 10 games"
- "Colorado Avalanche goals per game last 5 games"
- "Vegas Golden Knights goals against per game this season"
- "Florida Panthers power play percentage this season"
- "New York Rangers penalty kill percentage last 10 games"
- "Tampa Bay Lightning home wins this season"
- "Dallas Stars road record last 15 games"'''
```

### 5. NHL-Specific Best Practices (Lines 1017-1019)
```python
- Use team names exactly as they appear in NHL
- Ask about standard team stats: record, goals scored/allowed, power play/penalty kill stats, home/road splits
- Arena-specific queries work for major NHL venues
```

### 6. NHL-Specific Web Searches (Lines 1025-1028)
```python
- Starting goalie confirmations and backup situations
- Back-to-back game situations and rest days
```

### 7. NHL-ONLY Response Format (Lines 1042-1061)
**AI instructions now say:**
```python
"research_strategy": "NHL-EXCLUSIVE hockey research strategy - IGNORE all other sports!"
"statmuse_queries": [
    // NHL team queries ONLY (different teams, varied bet types, goalie matchups)
    {
        "query": "[Diverse Team Name] [varied stat/matchup] this season",
        "priority": "high/medium/low",
        "sport": "NHL"  # ‚Üê MUST be NHL only!
    }
]

**CRITICAL**: Research ONLY NHL teams from the games data - DO NOT research MLB, NFL, CFB, or any other sports!
```

### 8. Class Initialization (Line 504)
```python
self.nhl_only_mode = False  # Can be set externally via --sport NHL
```

## Database Configuration
- **Sport Name in DB**: "National Hockey League"
- **Available Games**: 14 NHL games for Oct 9-10
- **Sport Counts Include**: NHL added to all counting dictionaries
- **Distribution Logic**: NHL included in pick allocation

## Test Command
```bash
python teams_enhanced.py --tomorrow --sport NHL --picks 6
```

## Expected Behavior
‚úÖ **Fetches ONLY NHL games** (not MLB/CFB/NFL)
‚úÖ **AI researches ONLY hockey teams** (no baseball/football)
‚úÖ **StatMuse queries focus on NHL stats** (goals, power play, penalty kill)
‚úÖ **Web searches focus on goalies** (starting goalies, backups, rest days)
‚úÖ **Generates 6 NHL picks** from diverse teams
‚úÖ **Saves with sport: "NHL"** in database

## Prompt Engineering Highlights
1. **Explicit sport filtering**: "IGNORE all other sports!"
2. **Hockey-specific examples**: Only NHL teams in examples
3. **Goalie focus**: Emphasizes starting goalie confirmations
4. **Arena-specific**: References NHL venues
5. **Hockey stats**: Goals, power play, penalty kill (not runs/points)
6. **Back-to-back awareness**: NHL-specific rest day considerations
