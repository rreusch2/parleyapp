4\. Personalization: Allow users to customize their experience, such as preferred sports, teams, and betting markets. 

5\. Performance: The UI must be fast and responsive, especially when displaying real-time odds and dynamic content. 

6\. Mobile-First Design: Given it's a React Native app, prioritize a seamless experience on mobile devices.
