## 2. Proposing Methods to Expose the n8n RAG Workflow as an API/Webhook

To enable your AI systems (especially Professor Lock) to access and utilize the n8n RAG workflow as a callable tool, the n8n workflows need to be exposed as external endpoints. n8n provides robust capabilities for this, primarily through the use of Webhook nodes. This approach allows external applications to trigger n8n workflows by sending HTTP requests.

### 2.1. Exposing the 'Retriever Flow' as an API Endpoint

The 'Retriever Flow' is designed to receive a chat message, query the vector database, and generate a response using an AI Agent. To make this accessible to your AI systems, it should be triggered by an external HTTP request.

**Proposed Method:**

1.  **Webhook Node as Trigger:** The 'Retriever Flow' in your screenshot likely already uses a trigger node that listens for incoming messages (e.g., 'When chat message received'). This node can be configured as a 'Webhook' node in n8n. A Webhook node generates a unique URL that, when an HTTP POST request is sent to it, triggers the workflow.
2.  **Input Parameters:** The incoming HTTP request (from your AI system) would contain the user's query (the 'chat message'). This query would be passed as a parameter in the request body (e.g., JSON payload).
3.  **Output Response:** After the 'AI Agent' node processes the query and generates a response, an 'Respond to Webhook' node would be used at the end of the 'Retriever Flow'. This node sends an HTTP response back to the calling AI system, containing the generated answer from Professor Lock, potentially along with any retrieved document snippets or metadata.

**Example Flow (Conceptual):**

*   **AI System (e.g., Grok/Professor Lock):** Makes an HTTP POST request to the 'Retriever Flow's Webhook URL with a JSON payload like `{"query": "What are the key insights on team performance?"}`.
*   **n8n 'Retriever Flow':**
    *   `Webhook` node receives the request.
    *   The `query` parameter is extracted and passed to the 'Google Gemini Chat Model' and 'Query Data Tool'.
    *   The 'AI Agent' processes the information.
    *   `Respond to Webhook` node sends back a JSON response like `{"answer": "Based on our analysis, key insights on team performance include...", "source_documents": [...]}`.

### 2.2. Exposing the 'Load Data Flow' for Data Ingestion

The 'Load Data Flow' is responsible for ingesting data into the vector database. This workflow would need to be triggered whenever new documents (company documents, gambling guides, etc.) need to be added or updated in the RAG system.

**Proposed Method:**

1.  **Webhook Node as Trigger:** Similar to the 'Retriever Flow', the 'Load Data Flow' would start with a 'Webhook' node. This webhook would be triggered by an external system (e.g., a data pipeline, a manual upload process, or even another n8n workflow).
2.  **Input Parameters:** The incoming HTTP request would contain the data to be ingested. This could be:
    *   **File Upload:** The request could include the document file itself (e.g., as `multipart/form-data`). The 'Upload your file here' node in your screenshot suggests this capability.
    *   **Text Content:** The request could contain the raw text content of the document, along with metadata (e.g., `{"document_id": "doc123", "content": "...", "category": "gambling_guide"}`).
    *   **URL to Document:** The request could provide a URL from which n8n should fetch the document.
3.  **Processing and Response:** The workflow would then proceed to 'Insert Data to Store' (your vector database). A 'Respond to Webhook' node would confirm successful ingestion or report any errors.

**Example Flow (Conceptual):**

*   **External System:** Makes an HTTP POST request to the 'Load Data Flow's Webhook URL with the document data.
*   **n8n 'Load Data Flow':**
    *   `Webhook` node receives the document/data.
    *   'Default Data Loader' and 'Insert Data to Store' nodes process and embed the data.
    *   `Respond to Webhook` node sends back a status like `{"status": "success", "message": "Document ingested successfully"}`.

By implementing these webhook-based API endpoints, your AI systems can programmatically interact with the n8n RAG workflow, enabling dynamic data retrieval and knowledge base updates. This creates a powerful tool that your Grok model can leverage through function calling or similar mechanisms.


## 3. Defining the Input/Output Schema for the RAG Tool

To ensure seamless communication between your AI systems (especially Grok/Professor Lock) and the n8n RAG workflows, it is crucial to define clear and consistent input and output schemas for the exposed API endpoints.

### 3.1. Schema for the RAG Retrieval Endpoint (for Professor Lock)

This endpoint will be used by Professor Lock (or any other AI component needing to retrieve information from the RAG system) to query the knowledge base and receive an augmented response.

**Endpoint:** `/rag/query` (or similar, depending on n8n webhook configuration)
**Method:** `POST`

**Input Schema (JSON Body):**

```json
{
  "query": "string",
  "user_id": "string",
  "conversation_id": "string",
  "context": "string" (optional)
}
```

*   **`query` (string, required):** The natural language question or prompt from the user that Professor Lock needs to answer using the RAG system. This is the core input for retrieval.
*   **`user_id` (string, required):** A unique identifier for the user. This is crucial for personalization and potentially for logging/auditing purposes. It allows the RAG system to understand if there's any user-specific context to consider (though the RAG itself might not directly use it, the AI Agent within n8n might).
*   **`conversation_id` (string, required):** A unique identifier for the current conversation session. This helps in maintaining conversational context within the n8n workflow if needed, and for tracking the flow of a multi-turn interaction.
*   **`context` (string, optional):** Any additional contextual information that Professor Lock wants to provide to the RAG system to refine the search. This could include previous turns in the conversation, specific topics being discussed, or any other relevant data that helps narrow down the retrieval.

**Output Schema (JSON Response):**

```json
{
  "answer": "string",
  "retrieved_documents": [
    {
      "id": "string",
      "content_snippet": "string",
      "source": "string",
      "metadata": {
        "title": "string" (optional),
        "author": "string" (optional),
        "date": "string" (optional),
        "category": "string" (optional)
      }
    }
  ],
  "confidence_score": "number" (optional),
  "error": "string" (optional)
}
```

*   **`answer` (string, required):** The AI-generated response to the `query`, augmented by the retrieved documents. This is the primary output that Professor Lock will use to respond to the user.
*   **`retrieved_documents` (array of objects, optional):** A list of document snippets that were retrieved by the RAG system and used to formulate the `answer`. Each object in the array would contain:
    *   **`id` (string):** Unique identifier of the retrieved document.
    *   **`content_snippet` (string):** A relevant excerpt from the retrieved document that directly supports the `answer`.
    *   **`source` (string):** The origin of the document (e.g., "Company Policy Manual", "Gambling Strategy Guide", "MLB Rulebook").
    *   **`metadata` (object, optional):** Additional information about the document, such as title, author, date of publication, or category (e.g., "gambling_docs", "company_docs").
*   **`confidence_score` (number, optional):** A numerical value (e.g., 0.0 to 1.0) indicating the RAG system's confidence in the generated `answer` based on the quality and relevance of the retrieved documents. This can help Professor Lock decide how to present the information (e.g., with more or less certainty).
*   **`error` (string, optional):** If an error occurs during the RAG process, this field would contain a descriptive error message.

### 3.2. Schema for the RAG Data Ingestion Endpoint (for Loading Documents)

This endpoint will be used to programmatically upload new documents or update existing ones in the RAG system's knowledge base.

**Endpoint:** `/rag/ingest` (or similar)
**Method:** `POST`

**Input Schema (JSON Body or Multipart Form Data):**

```json
{
  "document_id": "string" (optional, for updates),
  "content": "string" (required, if not file_url),
  "file_url": "string" (required, if not content),
  "metadata": {
    "title": "string" (required),
    "author": "string" (optional),
    "date": "string" (optional),
    "category": "string" (required, e.g., "company_policy", "gambling_strategy", "mlb_rules"),
    "tags": ["string"] (optional)
  }
}
```

*   **`document_id` (string, optional):** A unique identifier for the document. If provided, the system will attempt to update an existing document. If not provided, a new document will be created.
*   **`content` (string, required if `file_url` is not provided):** The raw text content of the document to be ingested. This is suitable for smaller text-based documents.
*   **`file_url` (string, required if `content` is not provided):** A URL from which n8n can fetch the document. This is suitable for larger documents or documents hosted externally.
*   **`metadata` (object, required):** A dictionary containing structured information about the document. This metadata will be stored alongside the document's embeddings and can be used for filtering or enriching retrieval results.
    *   **`title` (string, required):** The title of the document.
    *   **`author` (string, optional):** The author of the document.
    *   **`date` (string, optional):** The publication or creation date of the document (e.g., 


"YYYY-MM-DD").
    *   **`category` (string, required):** A classification of the document (e.g., "company_policy", "gambling_strategy", "mlb_rules"). This is crucial for targeted retrieval.
    *   **`tags` (array of strings, optional):** Keywords or phrases that further describe the document.

**Output Schema (JSON Response):**

```json
{
  "status": "string",
  "message": "string",
  "document_id": "string" (optional),
  "error": "string" (optional)
}
```

*   **`status` (string, required):** Indicates the result of the ingestion operation (e.g., "success", "failed").
*   **`message` (string, required):** A human-readable message describing the outcome of the operation.
*   **`document_id` (string, optional):** The ID of the document that was ingested or updated.
*   **`error` (string, optional):** If an error occurs, this field would contain a descriptive error message.

By adhering to these schemas, your AI systems can reliably send requests to and receive responses from the n8n RAG workflow, making it a well-defined and usable tool within your ecosystem.


## 4. How AI Systems (Grok/Professor Lock) Would Use the RAG Tool

Integrating the n8n RAG workflow as a callable tool for your AI systems, particularly the Grok model and Professor Lock chatbot, will significantly enhance their capabilities by providing access to a specialized, curated knowledge base. This section outlines how this integration would function.

### 4.1. Grok as the Orchestrator: Function Calling

The Grok model, as your primary Large Language Model (LLM), will act as the intelligent orchestrator. Modern LLMs, including Grok, can be equipped with a "function calling" or "tool use" capability. This means that when prompted, the LLM can decide to call an external function (like your n8n RAG endpoint) to fulfill a user's request or gather necessary information.

**Process:**

1.  **Tool Definition:** Grok's system prompt would be updated to include a clear definition of the RAG tool. This definition would specify:
    *   **Tool Name:** e.g., `rag_knowledge_base`
    *   **Tool Description:** A natural language explanation of what the tool does (e.g., "Retrieves relevant information from a specialized knowledge base of company documents and gambling guides based on a query.")
    *   **Input Parameters:** The expected JSON schema for the input to the RAG retrieval endpoint (as defined in Section 3.1), including `query`, `user_id`, `conversation_id`, and `context`.
    *   **Output Schema:** The expected JSON schema for the output from the RAG retrieval endpoint, including `answer`, `retrieved_documents`, `confidence_score`, and `error`.

2.  **User Query/Internal Need:** A user interacts with Professor Lock, or an internal process within `teams.py`, `props.py`, or `intelligent_professor_lock_insights.py` determines that external knowledge is required.

3.  **Grok's Decision:** Based on the user's query or the internal need, Grok analyzes its internal knowledge and the available tools. If it determines that the `rag_knowledge_base` tool is the most appropriate way to answer the question or gather information, it will generate a structured function call.

    **Example Grok-generated function call (conceptual):**
    ```json
    {
      "tool_name": "rag_knowledge_base",
      "parameters": {
        "query": "What are the regulations for sports betting in New Jersey?",
        "user_id": "user123",
        "conversation_id": "conv456",
        "context": "User is asking about legal aspects of betting."
      }
    }
    ```

4.  **Execution by Application Logic:** This structured function call is not executed directly by Grok. Instead, your application's backend (where Grok is integrated) intercepts this call. It then makes an actual HTTP POST request to the n8n RAG workflow's webhook URL, passing the `parameters` generated by Grok as the JSON body.

5.  **n8n RAG Workflow Execution:** The n8n 'Retriever Flow' receives the request, performs the retrieval from the vector database, uses the 'AI Agent' (which might also be powered by Grok or another LLM) to synthesize an answer, and returns the response via the 'Respond to Webhook' node.

6.  **Grok's Response Integration:** Your application receives the JSON response from the n8n RAG workflow. This response is then fed back to Grok as a tool output. Grok can then use this retrieved information to formulate its final, comprehensive answer to the user, citing the sources from `retrieved_documents` if appropriate.

### 4.2. Enhancing Professor Lock's Capabilities

For Professor Lock, the RAG system will be a game-changer, moving it beyond general knowledge and web search to provide highly specific, authoritative, and contextually relevant information from your curated documents.

*   **Access to Proprietary Information:** Professor Lock can now answer questions about your company's internal policies, specific app features, or proprietary betting strategies that are documented internally, without needing to be explicitly trained on this data.
*   **Authoritative Gambling Knowledge:** By ingesting comprehensive gambling guides, rulebooks, and advanced strategy documents, Professor Lock can become a true expert, providing nuanced advice and explanations on complex betting concepts.
*   **Reduced Hallucinations:** By grounding its responses in retrieved documents, the RAG system significantly reduces the likelihood of Professor Lock 


generating incorrect or fabricated information, as it relies on factual data from the knowledge base.
*   **Dynamic and Up-to-Date Information:** As new documents are ingested into the RAG system via the `rag/ingest` endpoint, Professor Lock will automatically have access to the latest information without requiring a full model retraining.
*   **Improved Personalization:** While the RAG system itself doesn't directly handle personalization, the `user_id` and `conversation_id` passed to it can be used by the AI Agent within the n8n workflow to retrieve user-specific context from a separate user profile database (as discussed in the previous tool recommendation report), further tailoring the RAG output.

### 4.3. Leveraging RAG in `teams.py`, `props.py`, and `intelligent_professor_lock_insights.py`

While Professor Lock is the most direct beneficiary, the RAG system can also provide valuable context and information to the other AI components, enriching their predictions and insights.

*   **`teams.py` (Team Predictions):**
    *   **Contextual Rules/Strategies:** The RAG system could store documents detailing specific betting strategies for certain team matchups or game conditions (e.g., "Strategies for betting on home underdogs," "Impact of travel schedules on team performance"). Before making a pick, `teams.py` could query the RAG for relevant strategic advice based on the current game context.
    *   **Team-Specific Nuances:** Documents on specific team philosophies, coaching tendencies, or historical performance under certain conditions (e.g., "How Team X performs after a bye week," "Coach Y's strategy in playoff games"). This qualitative data can add depth to quantitative predictions.

*   **`props.py` (Player Prop Predictions):**
    *   **Player-Specific Insights:** The RAG could contain detailed scouting reports, player injury histories (beyond what's immediately available via news feeds), or articles analyzing a player's performance against specific types of opponents or in particular venues. For example, if a player has a known struggle against left-handed pitchers, the RAG could provide historical context from a detailed scouting report.
    *   **Prop-Specific Strategies:** Documents outlining strategies for specific player prop types (e.g., "Factors influencing strikeout totals for pitchers," "Analyzing rebound opportunities for centers").

*   **`intelligent_professor_lock_insights.py` (Daily Insights):**
    *   **Deep Dive Context:** When generating insights, this script could query the RAG system for background information on historical events, rule changes, or complex statistical concepts that add depth to its analysis. For example, if discussing a team's recent offensive surge, the RAG could provide historical examples of similar surges and their underlying causes.
    *   **Gambling Education:** The RAG system could be a source for explaining complex betting terms or concepts within the insights, making them more accessible to a wider audience.
    *   **Company-Specific Narratives:** Documents containing approved narratives or key messages about the Parley app itself, ensuring consistency in how insights are framed.

In these cases, the Python scripts would make HTTP requests to the n8n RAG retrieval endpoint, similar to how Grok would. The retrieved information would then be integrated into their internal reasoning processes before generating predictions or insights. This allows them to access a rich, curated knowledge base that goes beyond what can be found through general web searches or basic API calls.


## 5. Conclusion and Architectural Overview

Integrating the n8n RAG workflow as a callable tool for your AI systems represents a significant leap forward in enhancing the Parley app's intelligence and utility. By exposing the RAG system via well-defined API endpoints, your Grok model and other AI components can dynamically access and leverage a curated knowledge base, leading to more informed predictions, richer insights, and a highly personalized conversational experience for users.

### 5.1. Summary of Key Integration Points:

*   **Webhook-based API Endpoints:** Both the 'Retriever Flow' (for querying) and the 'Load Data Flow' (for ingestion) of the n8n RAG workflow will be exposed as HTTP POST endpoints, allowing programmatic interaction from external systems.
